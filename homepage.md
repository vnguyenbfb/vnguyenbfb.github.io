> A DATA ENTHUSIAST, <br>
> A SELF MOTIVATED MARKET RESEARCHER, <br>
> AND AN INSPIRING ENTERPRENEUR

I came from a multidiscipline background, with a bachelor degree in English linguistics and literature from the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Vietnam, and a dual-major MBA degree (under Fulbright scholarship) in Marketing and Finance from the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York. I have 17+ years of experience in market research and data analysis, supply chain, day trading and running my translation business serving the U.S. and Asian markets.

In my backbone, I love working with numbers and all the fun logics that come with it. With determination to grow my career as a data analyst, I have been training full time on programming for the past two years in SQL, Python and Tableau. I am now ready for a fulltime position as a data analyst. 

While I am confident with the training and achievements I have gained, my enthusiasm for continuous growth and adaptibility would be my utimate driving force for any position I will be taking on.

In my spare time, I love cooking for my family and friends. Seeing everyone enjoying my food is actually a joy itself. I also have a passion for martial art with a black belt in Taekwondo and yellow belt in Karate.
