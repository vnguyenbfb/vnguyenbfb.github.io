We will use the daily climate records of Ann Arbor Michigan from a subset of The National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Global Historical Climatology Network daily (GHCNd) 
(GHCN-Daily) to plot line graphs of the record high and record low temperatures by the day of the year over the period 2005-2014.
