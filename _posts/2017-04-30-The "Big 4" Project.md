In this project, we will read into a file of metropolitan regions and associated sports teams. Each of these regions may have one or more teams from the "Big 4": NFL, MLB, NBA or NHL.
We will analyze the data from the perspective of the metropolitan region. Thus teams which are commonly known by a different area need to be mapped into the metropolitan region given.
