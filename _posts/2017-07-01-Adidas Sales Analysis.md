### 1. Introduction

The Adidas Sales Database is an interesting dataset that shows us Adidas business landscape in 2020-2021 where we can drill down to retailer, region, state, product, sales methods and profitability level. The dataset is big and clean enough for deep analysis and visualization to help provide a thorough story of the brand as well as guide the management’s decisions in their future actions.

The dataset can be found [here](https://data.world/stellabigail/adidas-us-sales-datasets).

### 2. Why is this dataset chosen?

My background is in marketing and market research, and this Adidas Sales Database looks very interesting to me as it shows us Adidas business landscape in 2020-2021. My criteria were: it should be business related, clean, robust and have the measures I intend to do my analysis with.

With this dataset, we can drill down to retailer, region, state, product, sales methods and profitability level. The dataset is big and clean enough for powerful analysis and visualization to help provide a full story of the brand as well as guide the management’s decisions in their future actions.

However, the dataset includes many meaningful measures that I can make interesting analysis and viz with. This dataset stands out from dozens of datasets I've come across in terms of measure diversity and data cleanliness.

### 3.	Analysis Outline

We will start with exploratory analysis first before we can identify a story to Adidas brand’s overview and detailed performance. We will make it into multiple dashboards and present it in powerpoint format.

Because the analysis was to answer both the General Director and the Sales Manager, it was approached on both overview level and specific levels. Different measures was considered.
Multi-frame data story with multiple story points was used for user-friendly story telling.

### 6. Analysis
Figure 1

According to Figure 1, West Gear, Foot Locker and Sports Direct are the three leading retailers in terms of revenue. Noticeably, Sports Direct gains the most profit margin while West Gear and Footlocker's profit margin is almost on par with the rest retailers. Walmart can be worked on as it generates the least sales with lowest profit ratio.

West is the top region in terms of revenue and quite far ahead from the second which is Northeast and the third which is Southeast. Profit ratio shows a reversed picture. Pricing strategies may be different among regions. It is worth looking further into any discount scheme currently in place or in the future. (Figure 2)

Figure 3

It is quite similar when looking at performance by state. States that gain less sales are mostly those with higher profit ratio (Figure 3)

Figure 4

<img src="/assets/images/P9_6.png">

Figure 4 is a clear picture of how each product is performing over time. Men's Street Footwear, Women's Apparel and Men's Athletic Footwear are the top sellers. 

In short term, there is a decrease in Men's Street Footwear and Men's Athletic Footwear's from Q3 to Q4 while Women's Apparel's sales is stagnant since Q2.

Figure 5 offers a deeper drills into how each product is performing in each region. 

Women's Apparel is the most highly priced product and generates quite good margin, except for in the West. 

On the other hand, Men's Apparel ranks second in terms of pricing but generate quite poor margin compared to other products, except for in the West. 

Men's St Footwear is actually doing very well, especially in the West. It has big sales volumn, medium range price, and quite good margin.

In-Store and Online are close winners in terms of sales. 

However, In-Store generates the least profit ratio due to its fixed cost on rental and staffing.

Online is still the most profitable method and should be focused on growing.

### 7. Findings

* West Gear, Foot Locker and Sports Directs are the best retailers for Adidas AG. 
* Best selling products are Men's Street Footwear, Women's Apparel and Men's Athletic Footwear. 
* It is quite interesting to see that regions/states that generate most total sales secure less profitability.
* Women's Apparel is the most highly priced product and generates quite good margin, except for in the West. On the other hand, Men's Apparel ranks second in terms of pricing but generates quite poor margin compared to other products, except for in the West. Men's St Footwear is actually doing very well, especially in the West. It has big sales volumn, medium range price, and quite good margin.
* In-Store is the most sales generating method but Online gains the most profit ratio.
  
### 8. Recommendations

The biggest problem for Adidas AG is that regions/states that generate most total sales secure less profitability. 
* In the West, Addidas’s Women’s Appeal is selling well, at the highest price compared to the rest of Addidas products, but it is generating the least margin. 
* In the other regions, Men's Apparel generates quite poor margin, despite its high pricing 
* The following can be considered. 
    · Conduct a survey for consumers’ feedback to understand about their behavior and satisfaction of using these particular products 
    · Advertise more to raise brand awareness and/or retain users. 
    · Is operating cost too higher? 
    · Is retailer commission too high on this product? 

Growth opportunity for Adidas AG is in their online business. There is a fierce race among brands in terms of digitalizing their brands. A website that is eye-catchy and user friendly would tremendously help grow the business. This change should also be coupled with excellent customer service, an easy only payment system and great return policy.
