#### Nike Logistics Coordinator, Maersk Shipping and Logistics (2006-2007) <br>
My first job as a fresh graduate was with Maersk Shipping and Logistics as a Nike Logistics Coordinator. Based on the data of forecast inbound shipments from Nike vendors in Vietnam, I planned for the shipment capacity and schedule for the month, utilizing the container loading process to maximize our shipping profits. It was a satisfying job because it was like solving your puzzles with weights and dimensions of the shipments for loading optimization. <br><br>

#### Market Research Executive, Nielsen Market Reseach Company (2007-2009) <br>
I wanted to take on a bigger scope with projects that required end-to-end responsibility, from requirement understanding, data analysis and insight discovery, to decision recommendation. Thus I applied to be a Market Research Executive at the Nielsen Market Reseach Company.

Because of my data analysis and communication skills, the company created a first-ever, cross-department position for me to work across Retail Audit (understanding market through stores) and Quantitative Customized Research (understanding market through end consumers). Due to the complexity of the data platform and anlaysis work involved, staffs typically worked on one side, figured out what information they need from the other, then requested assistance to get it. My role, on the other hand, required that I work with two seprate data platforms to drill down simultaneously from both perspectives.  As a result, I was able to come up with more powerful insights on how to better connect them.

For all the global brands that were using Nielsen’s services, usually it was their Sales teams that were keen on Retail Audit reports while Marketing teams on Customized Project reports. Being able to analyze and combine the data from both angles allowed me to offer a full picture of the brand health with more meaningful insights and actionable recommendations. I was proud to possess such skills. My contribution helped our team to build more trust and tighten the relationship with global brands. 

This job assignment vastly motivated me to grow strongly and comprehensively with my data analysis and project management skills. I worked there for two years before I won Fulbright, a rather competitive scholarship, for a full scholarship to pursue my MBA degree in the U.S.<br><br>

#### Wholesale Buyer, C&S Wholesale Grocers (2012-2014) <br>
After acquiring my MBA degree in Marketing and Finance from RIT in New York (2009-2011), I moved to Massachusetts. Here I started the job of a Wholesale Meat Buyer at C&S Wholesale Grocers, one of the biggest grocery wholesale companies in the U.S. Because fresh meat is perishable with only seven day life from packaging till expiration, the job needed careful forecast and quick reaction to change in demand. My job which was to manage inventory in warehouses in the three states in the U.S required constant analyses and forecast of the stores’ demand, in order to avoid the loss from expired items. I was able to maintain a good flow of the inventory to the market and quicky react to the constantly changing demand from the stores especially during their promotion programs. <br><br>

#### DayTrader (2016-2022) <br>
Our family moved to Mountain View, California. I daytraded from 2016 to early 2022. It fitted my schedule well as a full time mom: momentum daytrading at market open and taking care of our daughters during the day. 

Daytrading was a fascinating world to me, as we daytraders focused solely on the technical analysis and the price action. I was amazed by the big pool of data we could access, giving us the ability to analyze it however we wanted to look at it. Momentum daytrading was challenging and exciting at the same time as I had to make splashing fast decisions based purely on what the price action was telling me. I taught myself how to setup and utilze technical analysis (EMA, SMA, doji, technical trendline,…) to customize them in my trading.<br><br>
 
#### My Translation Business (2011-Present) <br>
Since I got my MBA in 2011, I have been working as a translation service provider, initially for the U.S. market. Standing out with my consistent quality, I have gained solid trust and become the sole provider of Vietnamese translation to many of my clients. The business has grown to a stable size of 15 freelance translators. While the U.S. is still my biggest area of focus, I have expanded the business to also serve leading market research companies in Vietnam and the Regional GoJek’s Market Research Team. Our services include translation, transcription, voice over, proofreading, ect. We also provide yearly training to Vietnamese liasons in public schools in Massachusetts.
